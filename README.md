Hey there! I’m Mitul Nayakwadi, a passionate technologist navigating the dynamic worlds of C, Python, Data Structures & Algorithms, AI, and Web Development.

I believe in respecting the wisdom of traditional approaches while relentlessly seeking new ways to innovate and build solutions for the future.

I’m currently:

🔍 Sharpening my skills in C and Python fundamentals

🚀 Exploring projects that blend AI with practical applications

🛠️ Tinkering with web development tools to create meaningful digital experiences

⏱️ Committing ~2 hours daily to deep work and learning

I’m driven by curiosity but always skeptical enough to question how things work—and how they could work better. I value craftsmanship, clean code, and building things that last.
